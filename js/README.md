# Prototype Square Tactics

Goal: simple tactics game prototype

Progress: so far we have something like checkers with no movement restrictions, bad starting locations, and infinite respawn of pieces.


Next steps:
- user selects piece -> user clicks 'move' or 'attack' -> display valid targets -> user clicks target
- different units with different abilities (like, _wildly_ different: orthogonally different abilities. Not just different stat numbers)
- maybe eventually make an iso-grid version
