# A JS remake of the Royal Game of Ur # 
( see tom scott video)

Trying to make a pass-and-playable version of the Royal Game of Ur to be hosted on LAN so we can pass and play on an android tablet.

So, what do I need:
    - JS canvas game template
    - A backround image of the game board (eventually)
    - Token/dice images (eventally -> polish stage)
    - Clickable Areas
    - possible prototype build with grid squares (only on-the-board squares are active ones
    - player pieces (circles for now)
    - dice simulations (random 1s and 0s for now)
    - logic rules defining possible player actions.
